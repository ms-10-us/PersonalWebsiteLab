                    In this project, we developed a self-service terminal for a grocery store. The project was a console
                    application developed using C#. It was a team effort, and my team had to use different object oriented
                    programming concepts to meet the required development specifications.

                    This project was an individual effort. I developed a console application for a fitness center 
                    to help manage members and membership options. I did this project to gain extra-practice using
                    C# programming language.
