                    I am a mechanical engineer. I studied mechanical engineering at Wayne State University. The last position 
                    that I held was SIL/HIL Core Models Engineer at Ford Motor Company. After being laid off from my role, I
                    decided to make a career change and become a software developer. I am currently attending the Grand Circus 
                    Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

                    Three weeks ago I accepted a job offer at United Wholsale Mortgage. I will be part of their Dev-X Training 
                    program. I am very excited to start the position and learn new skills and technologies.
